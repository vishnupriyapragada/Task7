# Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Create and work with an SQLite database in Python
- Run SQL queries for data summarization
- Import SQL results into Pandas
- Display a basic sales summary
- Visualize sales revenue using Matplotlib

The dataset contains technical products (laptops, monitors, accessories, etc.) with their quantity and price details.  
The project outputs both a tabular summary and a sales chart.
